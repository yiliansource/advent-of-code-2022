# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022 🎄

This repository is a collection of my solutions for **Advent of Code 2022**, equipped together with a runner to easily execute and validate them. The solutions are all written in TypeScript.

![The test runner.](https://github.com/yiliansource/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/.github/test-runner.png)

## Running

First, install dependencies using `yarn`. After that you can use `yarn start` to compute actual output or `yarn test` to validate test input. Type `yarn start --help` for a list of supported command line arguments.
